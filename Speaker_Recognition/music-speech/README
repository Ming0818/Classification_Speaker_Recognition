This directory contains a set of some 240 15-second extracts collected
'at random' from the radio by Eric Scheirer during his internship at
Interval Research Corporation in the summer of 1996.  This is the
database used in:

  E. Scheirer & M. Slaney (1997)
  Construction And Evaluation Of A Robust Multifeature Speech/music
  Discriminator 
  Proc. ICASSP-97, Munich.
  http://rvl4.ecn.purdue.edu/~malcolm/interval/1996-085/SpeechMusicICASSP97.pdf

It was also used, for comparison, in the paper Gethin and I did:

  G. Williams & D. Ellis (1999)
  Speech/music discrimination based on posterior probability features 
  Proc. Eurospeech-99, Budapest. 
  ftp://ftp.icsi.berkeley.edu/pub/speech/papers/euro99-mussp.pdf

The data is broken up into training and test portions, and further
categorized as containing speech, music (with or without vocals),
speech over music, plus a few examples of 'other' (birdsong).  

Gethin and I produced a complete lexical transcript of the set
(including the spanish utterances!), it is in wrdfile/musicspeech.ref .
The wrdfile/ directory includes a messy pile of derivative files that
we used for various tests.

In 2001, Adam Berenzweig produced time-aligned labels for all the music 
data to distinguish between the vocals and musical accompaniment parts. 
This was used to train a vocals/music discriminator, described in:

  A.L. Berenzweig & D.P.W. Ellis (2001)
  Locating singing voice segments within music signals
  Proc. IEEE WASPAA, Mohonk NY, October 2001.
  http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/pubs/waspaa01-singing.pdf

Label files for the speech and music portions only (not the m+s) are
included in the mvlabfile directory, in <start> <duration> <label> format, 
where start and duration are in seconds.  For the speech only files, 
the labels are simply one line: "0 15.000 speech".  For the 
music files, there can be several lines indicating segments of 
"mus" (just instruments) and "vox" (vocals over instruments).  

When preparing the labels, we found that files 2, 3, 12, 14, 17 and 21
in the test/music/novocals directory did in fact contain vocals (and
are labelled accordingly).

Originally, there was a file 61 in the training/music directory, but it 
was a garbage file and has now been removed.

Here's a brief list of directories:

159504  ./wavfile                       Contains all 245 audio files, 
					each in MSWAV format, each 15s long

13044   ./wavfile/test/speech		20 examples of speech alone
13696   ./wavfile/test/music/novocals	21 examples of music without vocals
13044   ./wavfile/test/music/vocals	20 examples of music with vocals

39124   ./wavfile/train/speech		60 examples of speech alone
39124   ./wavfile/train/music		60 examples of music (vocal+novocal)
